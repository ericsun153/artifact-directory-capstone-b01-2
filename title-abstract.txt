Title:
Mitigating/Grading Misinformation and Disinformation with Hybrid Model AI

Abstract:
The proliferation of fake news and misinformation, often amplified by large language models (LLMs), poses a significant threat to societal trust and stability. This paper introduces a hybrid veracity detection and scoring framework that leverages both generative AI and traditional machine learning to detect, rank, and mitigate misinformation and disinformation across diverse media formats. Our approach decomposes content into structured analytical components, using an ensemble of factuality factors such as frequency heuristics, malicious account indicators, and psychological manipulation cues to identify and assess deceptive patterns. By employing advanced techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fractal chain-of-thought prompting, and function calling, our system dynamically refines predictions, enhancing transparency and reducing hallucinations. This hybridized LLM-based veracity machine not only facilitates precise misinformation detection but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution for managing the complexities of content veracity in an evolving digital landscape.
